# Amazon_ML_Challenge_2025

This repository contains my solution for the Amazon Machine Learning Hackathon 2025, where the goal was to build a Smart Product Pricing model that predicts the optimal price of e-commerce products using their textual and visual data.

🚀 Overview

In e-commerce, determining the right price point is key to success. Our task was to predict product prices by analyzing descriptions, specifications, and other attributes.

The dataset included:

catalog_content – title, product description, and Item Pack Quantity (IPQ)

image_link – URL of the product image

price – target variable for training data

🧩 Approach

Our solution focused on capturing textual insights and structured patterns in the data.

🔹 Steps:

Text Preprocessing

Cleaned and normalized product text (title + description + quantity).

Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.

Feature Engineering

Combined structured features (like quantity) with TF-IDF text vectors.

Modeling

Used LightGBM for regression due to its speed, robustness, and ability to handle sparse data efficiently.

Tuned hyperparameters using validation splits.

Evaluation

Evaluated the model using SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

Final SMAPE on leaderboard: 51.03
